### hi, i'm amber :)  

--> I'm your typical girl on the journey of learning to code ✨ I'm currently learning python and building a site with my friend :)

I love design, coding, and science - I want to become a biologist or something in the future ❤❤❤

I also love to read - still looking for more books to devour :P

My favourite thing is aesthetic vibes for some reason ✨

Random fact: fav colour = periwinkle

bye-bye
